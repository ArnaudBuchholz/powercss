  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><b>PowerCSS</b> is a JavaScript library that helps developers create
    responsive, double-buffered CSS that is optimized for performance.
    Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s">this
    presentation</a> for an an overview of CSS double-buffering.
    PowerCSS is all-new code with many additional capabilities
    and optimizations.<p>

    <p>The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss"
    >GitHub</a> and is available as an
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss">npm package</a>.
    It can be installed using <code>npm install powercss</code>.</p>

    <p>This page is styled using PowerCSS. Click at the top right to
      change the palette or cascade at any time. It looks good on a phone
      as well as a desktop.</p>

  <h2>Why PowerCSS?</h2>
    <p>A significant problem with traditional CSS, whether written
    by an expert or someone using <code>{less}</code> or <code>Sass</code>,
    is that it is <b>not</b> written as the application needs it.
    Styling that is responsive to the user's environment is either limited
    or simply not possible.</p>

    <p>PowerCSS provides tools to write and apply infinitely adjustable
    CSS based on almost any real-time data available to an application.
    For example, an application could use PowerCSS to adjust styling based on
    device orientation, ambient temperature, ambient light, GPS location,
    heart rate, or time of day. Traditional static CSS can't compete with
    this flexibility.</p>

    <p>We feel that PowerCSS has not only achieved its primary goal, but that
    it is often better than static CSS in many other respects as well.
    It provides a simple and familiar API where experienced CSS authors
    can use their existing skills to be up and running in minutes.
    When compressed, a PowerCSS solution can download and render faster,
    and it can speed up some CSS operations by 10x or more.
    What's not to like?</p>

  <h2>Key benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time styling</strong> - Application control of CSS
    enables custom styling for every user of your application. For example,
    adjust application styling based on device (capabilities, orientation 
    and size), GPS coordinates, and ambient conditions (light, temperature,
    time of day, heart rate).</li>
    <li><strong>Pure JS</strong> - Remove the need for <strong>any</strong>
    static CSS files.</li>
    <li><strong>Namespaced</strong> - PowerCSS plays well with jQuery, 
    other libraries, and third-party JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>Double-buffering</strong> is automatic and minimizes page
    re-flows. It can speed up some styling changes by more than 10x.</li>
    <li><strong>Merging and caching</strong> - Intelligent time-based minimal
    processing only changes the virtual cascades that need it.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixins</strong> at multiple levels - virtual stylesheet, 
    virtual cascade, and global. Change a mixin and watch the style change
    immediately!</li>
    <li><strong>Familiar workflow</strong> - Virtual stylesheets and virtual
    cascades are used to minimize the transition for CSS veterans.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine optimized CSS</strong> - PowerCSS provides only 
    <strong>one stylesheet</strong> for the browser to use at any given time,
    and <strong>numerous redundancies</strong> are removed during its
    preparation. This allows the browser to render more efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Highly compressible</strong> - PowerCSS can be compressed 
    to a fraction of static CSS. Both rule keys and values are 
    compressible.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality code</strong> - Expertly written and documented.
    Passes JSLint as a commit hook. We plan to include regression tests as
    a commit hook prior to 1.x release.</li>
    <li><strong>MIT license</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No dependencies</strong></li>

  <h2>News</h2>
    <h3>2016-03-04: Beta v0.5.20</h3>
    Preparations for regression tests. Added key benefits section.

    <h3>2016-02-24: Beta v0.5.16</h3>
    <p>This page now showcases double-buffer and theming capabilities.
    We have also completed the planned 1.x API with the addition of the
    <code>_getAssetIdList_</code> methods. At this point, all that remains
    is integration work and regression tests.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2016-02-24: Beta v0.5.00</h3>
    <p>PowerCss is nearly feature complete, and we consider it officially
    <b>Beta</b>. We have been updating examples and squashing niggling bugs
    as we find them.</p>

    <p>This version saw our last big API overhaul we expect before the 1.x
    release. We cut the number of methods in half while adding many
    capabilities. The documentation and examples have expanded and updated.
    We have added the PowerCSS Cookbook section to the
    <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss/blob/master/README.md"
    >GitHub Documentation</a> which we hope you find useful.

    <p>The work remaining includes documentation updates, example implementations,
    and regression tests. We hope to complete those tasks and see a 1.x release
    before the end of March 2016.</p>
