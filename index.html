  <h2>News</h2>
    <h3>2016-04-15: v1.1 released</h3>
    <p>We have added support for arbitrary-depth conditional 
    CSS and media queries. See the <b>Conditional Expressions</b> section of updated
    <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss/blob/master/README.md"
     target="_blank">GitHub Documentation</a>. We added 22 regression tests to
     ensure quality and reliability.</p>
   
    <p>The API remains almost completely backwards compatible in this release
    which we feel is a major accomplishment given the requirements of
    conditional expressions.  The only exception is that the irregular
    symbol names containing "bottom" have been made consistent.
    For example, <code>border_btm</code> has been renamed to
    <code>border_bottom</code> as the former was needlessly different
    from the CSS symbol.</p>

  <h2>What</h2>
    <p><b>PowerCSS</b> is a JavaScript library that helps developers create
    responsive, double-buffered CSS that is optimized for performance.
    Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s"
    target="_blank">this presentation</a> for an an overview of CSS double-buffering.
    PowerCSS is all-new code with many additional capabilities
    and optimizations.<p>

    <p>The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss"
    target="_blank">GitHub</a> and is available as an
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss" target="_blank">npm package</a>.
    It can be installed using <code>npm install powercss</code>.</p>

    <p>This page is styled using PowerCSS. Click at the top right to
      change the palette or cascade at any time. It looks good on a phone
      as well as a desktop.</p>

  <h2>How</h2>
    <p>This page is styled using PowerCSS. Click at the top right to
      change the palette or cascade at any time.</p>

        - The basics</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._ex002_.html">Example 002</a>
        - Double buffering</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._ex003_.html">Example 003</a>
        - Mixin-maps</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._ex004_.html">Example 004</a>
        - Compression</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._ex005_.html">Example 005</a>
        - Dynamic themes</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>A significant problem with traditional CSS, whether written
    by an expert or someone using <code>{less}</code> or <code>Sass</code>,
    is that it is <b>not</b> written as the application needs it.
    Styling that is responsive to the user&apos;s environment is either limited
    or simply not possible.</p>

    <p>PowerCSS provides tools to write and apply infinitely adjustable
    CSS based on almost any real-time data available to an application.
    For example, an application could use PowerCSS to adjust styling based on
    device orientation, ambient temperature, ambient light, GPS location,
    heart rate, or time of day. Traditional static CSS can&apos;t compete with
    this flexibility.</p>

    <p>We feel that PowerCSS has not only achieved its primary goal, but that
    it is often better than static CSS in many other respects as well.
    It provides a simple and familiar API where experienced CSS authors
    can use their existing skills to be up and running in minutes.
    When compressed, a PowerCSS solution can download and render faster,
    and it can speed up some CSS operations by 10x or more.

    What&apos;s not to like?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real-time styling</strong> - Create 
      custom styling for every user of your application at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Pure JS</strong> - Remove the need for <strong>any</strong>
      static CSS files.</li>
      <li><strong>Namespaced</strong> - Play well with frameworks, jQuery, 
      other libraries, and third-party JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Double-buffering</strong> - Minimizes page re-flows with
      this automatic feature. It can speed up some styling changes by more 
      than 10x.</li>
      <li><strong>Merging and caching</strong> - Control when 
      your styling is updated using time-based minimal processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixins</strong> - Create custom symbols at multiple levels:
      virtual stylesheet, virtual cascade, and global.
      Change a mixin and watch the styles change immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Familiar workflow</strong> - Leverage your experience with
      static CSS files using virtual stylesheets and cascades.</li>
      <li><strong>Machine optimized CSS</strong> - Have the browser
      work more efficiently as only <strong>one stylesheet</strong> 
      is used for styling at any given time, and
      <strong>numerous redundancies</strong> are removed during its
      preparation.</li>
      <li><strong>Highly compressible</strong> - Compress your styling
      to a fraction of static CSS.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality code</strong> - Use well tested and documented code.
      A commit hook is  used to ensure no changes occur unless they pass
      <strong>JSLint</strong> <i>and</i> <strong>regression tests</strong>.

  <h2>Older News</h2>
    <h3>2016-03-25: v1.0</h3>
    <p>We feel the code is now production ready. It has strong set of regression
      tests and has been tested in a number of production and production-intent
      projects with good results. We plan to add per-cascade double-buffered
      stylesheets in the 1.2.x release.</p>
    <h3>2016-03-20: v0.7.1</h3>
    <p>We are very close to 1.x release.  The rule-map resolver has been
    revised to handle arbitrarily complex data structures. This allows us
    to create mixin maps that support any combination of alternate-lists,
    concatenations, and symbol-lookups.  The isolated code can be found in 
    be found in <code>test/resolve.js</code>. This has been merged
    with <code>dist/pcss.js</code>, however, we still need to move the
    tests to <code>test/t.js</code>.</p>

    <h3>2016-03-09: v0.6.6</h3>
    <p>Isn&apos;t regression testing grand?
    Just implementing basic coverage has
    turned up a few interesting bugs and needs.  One example: the process
    update test was sporadically failing about 1/10th of the time because
    sometimes the test JS proceeded before the CSS string processing
    completed.  So now we have events which are trigged by these processing
    steps (not yet supported in IE).  They are <code>_pcss_merged_</code>, 
    <code>_pcss_prepared_</code>, and <code>_pcss_used_</code>.  The event
    object provides the ID of the <strong>cascade</strong> affected.
    </p>

    <h3>2016-03-07: v0.6.2</h3>
    <p>Automated regression tests are now implemented.  You may run
    them using <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm test</code>
    in the root installation directory 
    (<code>node_modules/powercss/</code>).
    Code coverage metrics and production deployments are underway to
    help flush out any remaining refinements or bugs we may want to 
    address.
    </p>

    <h3>2016-03-04: v0.5.20</h3>
    Preparations for regression tests. Added key benefits section.

    <h3>2016-02-24: v0.5.16</h3>
    <p>This page now showcases double-buffer and theming capabilities.
    We have also completed the planned 1.x API with the addition of the
    <code>_getAssetIdList_</code> methods. At this point, all that remains
    is integration work and regression tests.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2016-02-24: v0.5.0</h3>
    <p>PowerCss is nearly feature complete, and we consider it officially
    <b>Beta</b>. We have been updating examples and squashing niggling bugs
    as we find them.</p>

    <p>This version saw our last big API overhaul we expect before the 1.x
    release. We cut the number of methods in half while adding many
    capabilities. The documentation and examples have expanded and updated.
    We have added the PowerCSS Cookbook section to the
    <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss/blob/master/README.md"
    target="_blank">GitHub Documentation</a> which we hope you find useful.</p>

    <p>The work remaining includes documentation updates, example
    implementations, and regression tests. We hope to complete those tasks
    and see a 1.x release before the end of March 2016.</p>
