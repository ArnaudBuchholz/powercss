  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><b>PowerCSS</b> is a JavaScript library that helps JavaScript
    developers create responsive, double-buffered CSS that is optimized
    for performance.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s"
    >I advocated CSS double-buffering </a> years ago, but PowerCSS is all-new
    code with many additional capabilities
    and optimizations.<p>

    The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss"
    >GitHub</a> and can be installed using
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss">npm install powercss</a>.

  <h2>Why PowerCSS?</h2>
  <p>A significant problem with traditional CSS files - whether written
  by an expert or someone using {less} or Sass - is that they are
  <b>not</b> written at run-time. Application-controlled styling that is
  responsive to the user's environment is either limited or simply not
  possible.</p>

  <p>PowerCSS provides our application the tools to write and apply infinitely
  adjustable CSS based on almost any real-time data available to us.
  For example, our application could use PowerCSS to adjust styling based on
  device orientation, ambient temperature, ambient light, GPS location,
  heart rate, or time of day. Traditional static CSS files can't compete with 
  this flexibility.</p>

  <p>We feel that PowerCSS has not only achieved its primary goal, but that 
  it is often better than static CSS in many other respects as well.
  It provides a simple and familiar API where experienced CSS authors
  can use their existing skills to be up and running in minutes.
  When properly implemented, a PowerCSS solution usually downloads
  faster, renders faster after loading, and can speed up some CSS
  operations by 10x or more. What's not to like?</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._example001_.html">Example 001</a>
        - The basics</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._example002_.html">Example 002</a>
        - Double buffering</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._example003_.html">Example 003</a>
        - Mixin-maps</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._example004_.html">Example 004</a>
        - Compression</li>
      <li><a href="examples/pcss._example005_.html">Example 005</a>
        - Dynamic themes</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pure JS</strong>
        - Remove the need for <strong>any</strong> static CSS files.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time styling</strong>
        - Application control of CSS enables custom 
          styling for every user of your application. For example, adjust
          application styling based on device (capabilities, orientation,
          and size), GPS coordinates, and ambient conditions (light,
          temperature, time of day, heart rate).</li>
      <li><strong>Double-buffering</strong> is automatic and minimizes
        page re-flows. It can speed up some styling changes by more than
        10x.</li>
      <li><strong>Merging and caching</strong> - Intelligent time-based
      minimal processing only changes the virtual cascades that need it.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mixins</strong> at multiple levels - virtual stylesheet,
        virtual cascade, and global.</li>
      <li><strong>Familiar workflow</strong> - Virtual stylesheets and 
        virtual cascades are used to minimize the transition for CSS 
        veterans.</li>
      <li><strong>Highly optimized CSS</strong> - PowerCSS presents only 
        <strong>one stylesheet</strong>
        for the browser rendering engine to use, and numerous redundancies
        are removed during its preparation. As a result the browser
        rendering engine can work much more efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Highly compressible</strong> - PowerCSS can be
        compressed to a fraction of the size of compressed static CSS.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality code</strong> - Expertly written and documented.
        Passes JSLint as a commit hook. We expect to include regression tests
        as a commit hook prior to 1.x release.</li>
      <li><strong>Namespaced</strong> - PowerCSS plays well with jQuery,
        other libraries, and third-party JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>No dependencies</strong></li>
      <li><strong>MIT license</strong></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>News</h2>
  <h3>2016-02-24: Beta v0.5.x</h3>
  <p>If youâ€™ve been sitting on the fence waiting for a stable API, your wait is over.
  PowerCss is nearly feature complete, and we consider it officially
  Beta. We have been updating examples and squashing niggling bugs as we find
  them.</p>

  <p>This version saw our last big API overhaul we expect before the 1.x
  release.  We cut the number of methods in half while adding many 
  capabilities. The documentation and examples have expanded and updated.
  We are especially proud of <strong>The PowerCSS Cookbook</strong> section.</p>

  <p>The work remaining includes documentation updates, example implementations,
  and regression tests. We hope to complete those tasks and see a 1.x release
  before the end of March 2016.</p>
